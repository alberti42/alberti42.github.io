title: Millennia Laser Control App
description: Application for controlling and logging Spectra-Physics Millennia Lasers. It covers all functions provided by the app shipped originally with the laser.
    It also provides new features, most notably, the possibility to log multiple parameters of the laser. Moreover, it gives a feedback about the instantaneous RMS noise level of the laser (5s integration time). And it allows controlling multiple lasers when these are connected to the same computer via USB.
