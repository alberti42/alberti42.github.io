title: Mapyter
description: A JupyterLab kernel to develop MATLAB in a notebook. The project started before Mathworks started [their development](https://de.mathworks.com/products/reference-architectures/jupyter.html) of MATLAB kernel for JupyterLab. It offers more advanced features than those currenlty provided by the official kernel, such as the possibility to update plots live, create animations, and display progress bar (even for `parfor` loops!). Unfortunately, the documentation page is still missing.
