title: BibDesk Integration Plugin
description: A plugin that integrates the macOS BibDesk application with the PDF++ plugin in Obsidian, enabling you to manage and open PDFs associated with BibDesk entries directly from Obsidian. It works with external BibTeX files, leveraging BibDeskâ€™s bdsk-file-<NUMBER> fields, which act as macOS bookmarks, allowing seamless file access even if files are renamed or moved.
