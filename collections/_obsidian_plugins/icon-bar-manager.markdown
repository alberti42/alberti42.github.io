title: Icon Bar Manager
description: A plugin for hiding undesired icons in Obisdian. Many plugins install icons without offering the possibility to hide them, resulting in a cluttered interface. The plugin allows controlling the order of the few icons one wishes to use. Unfortunately, the documentation page is missing. The plugin is also quite in a alpha stage and probably only useful to expert users who can tweak it.
