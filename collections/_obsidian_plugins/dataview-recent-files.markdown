title: Dataview Recent Files
description: A plugin visualizing a list of recently create and modified files in a fuzzy search modal in Obsidian. It extends the functionality of Obsidian Dataview plugin. The list of the recently created and modified files is determined by the frontmatter fields, rather than on the timestamp of the MarkDown file, which can change in an uncontrolled manner, especially if syncing the vault between multiple Obsidian devices. The dcumentation page is still misisng.
